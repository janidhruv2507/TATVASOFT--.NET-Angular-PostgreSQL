# TatvaSoft SQL Practice

This repository contains a comprehensive SQL script (`Postgre.sql`) that demonstrates core SQL concepts using a **student** and **department** schema, ideal for learning and practicing SQL with PostgreSQL.

---

## 📋 Overview

The SQL script covers a wide range of foundational and advanced SQL operations, including:

- **Table Creation**
  - `student` and `department` tables
- **Data Insertion**
  - Sample records for students and departments
- **Table Modifications**
  - Renaming columns
  - Adding new fields
  - Setting constraints
- **Data Manipulation**
  - `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, handling `NULL` values
- **Constraints**
  - `PRIMARY KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `FOREIGN KEY`
- **Data Queries**
  - `SELECT` with filtering (`WHERE`)
  - Pattern matching using `LIKE` and `ILIKE`
  - Sorting with `ORDER BY`
  - Aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
  - Grouping with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`
- **Pagination**
  - Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- **Join Operations**
  - `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`

## 🛠 How to Use

1. **Open** your PostgreSQL environment or a client tool (e.g., `psql`, `pgAdmin`).
2. **Run the entire SQL script** using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
psql -U your_username -d your_database -f Postgre.sql
```

> Replace `your_username` and `your_database` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.
